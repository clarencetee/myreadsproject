### Project Instructions

Once you have git cloned the project on your local directory, simply cd into your local directory
and run npm install to download the project dependencies.
Then run 'npm start' or 'yarn start' to view it in your browser

### Project dependencies

There are only a limited number of project dependencies which should have automatically installed with 'npm install' anyway, but you may want to check in node_modules that 'react-router-dom' exists
"prop-types": "^15.6.2",
"react": "^16.6.3",
"react-dom": "^16.6.3",
"react-router-dom": "^5.2.0",
"react-scripts": "2.1.1"

### Project Description:

This project is a book lending app that lets you search for and add books to your shelf.
On the home page is a list of populated books on the shelf that have been randomly selected into 3 categories:

1. Currently reading
2. Want to read
3. Read

Feel free to play around with these categorisations, and you can even classify them to 'none' to remove them from the shelf if you wish.

With the '+' button the bottom right hand corner, you can search for new books to add to the shelf.
Because the search functionality is currently supported by an external API, please bear with us if a search term returns no result/ error message!

Enjoy reading!
